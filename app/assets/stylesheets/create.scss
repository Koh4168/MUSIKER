 * 01/28/2016
 * This pen is years old, and watching at the code after all
 * those years made me fall from my chair, so I:
 * - changed all IDs to classes
 * - converted all units to pixels and em units
 * - changed all global elements to classes or children of
 *   .login
 * - cleaned the syntax to be more consistent
 * - added a lot of spaces that I so hard tried to avoid
 *   a few years ago
 *   (because it's cool to not use them)
 * - and probably something else that I can't remember anymore
 *
 * I sticked to the same philosophy, meaning:
 * - the design is almost the same
 * - only pure HTML and CSS
 * - no frameworks, preprocessors or resets
